# Quantum Coin Flip

This is a quantum toy app that showcases some beginner concepts of quantum computing such as superposition, measurement, non-locality, non-temporality, and entanglement.

## Quantum Coins 

Quantum coins are special in the following ways:

- When Quantum Coins are flipping they are in superposition.
- When Quantum Coins collide while they are flipping they become entangled.
- When a Quantum Coin hits the ground it is measured. Measuring an entangled Quantum Coin has the same effect as measuring an entangled qubit.

### States

| Coin          | Bit       | State       |
| ------------- | --------- | ----------- |
| Heads         | `0`       | `[1,0]`     |
| Tails         | `1`       | `[0,1]`     |

### Workflow

- User chooses the number of coins.
- User chooses the initial state of each coin.
- User can choose to entangle 2 coins.
- User flips the coins.
